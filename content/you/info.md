# About me
Iâ€™m a Russian American interface designer based in Pasadena, California. I was born and primarily raised in Moscow, and moved to California in 2014.

I hold a Design | Media Arts degree from UCLA. I was one of the only two interns ever at Are.na. I was "patient zero" of social justice feminism on the Russian web. I taught children how to program at UCode, and am currently at a programming retreat at the Recurse Center.
